# TreeLS
R functions for processing individual tree TLS point clouds

The package contains two scripts: `base_functions` containing all core functions necessary to pre-filter and fit circle/cylinder shapes to TLS point clouds, and `pre_sets`, containing routines that take entire tree point clouds as input and use the `base_functions` to perform stem pre-filtering or fitting over the whole tree.
