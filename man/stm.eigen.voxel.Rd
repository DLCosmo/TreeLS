\title{Stem denoising algorithm: Voxel geometry + voting}
\usage{
stm.eigen.voxel(h_step = 0.5, max_planarity = 0.2,
  max_verticality = 20, voxel_spacing = 0.1, max_d = 0.5,
  votes_weight = 0.2, v3d = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{h_step}{\code{numeric} - height interval to perform point filtering/assignment/classification.}

\item{max_planarity}{\code{numeric} - maximum planarity accepted when filtering a point neighborhood.}

\item{max_verticality}{\code{numeric} - maximum deviation of a point neighborhood's orientation from an absolute vertical axis ( Z = c(0,0,1) ), in \emph{degrees}.}

\item{voxel_spacing}{\code{numeric} - voxel side length.}

\item{max_d}{\code{numeric} - maximum diameter tolerated for a tree segment.}

\item{votes_weight}{\code{numeric} - fraction of votes a point neighborhood needs do reach in order to belong to a stem - in relation to the voxel with most votes with the same \emph{TreeID}.}

\item{v3d}{\code{logical} - count votes in 3D voxels (TRUE) or 2D pixels (FALSE).}
}
\description{
This function is meant to be used inside \code{\link{stemPoints}}. It filters points based on their voxel geometries (check \code{\link{pointMetrics}}) and assign them to stem patches if reaching a voxel with enough votes.
